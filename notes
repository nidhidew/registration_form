- my job role is software developer but i worked on frontend side of the project. its been 2 years now .
so i decided to continue with frontend and then start work on the backend after a while and learning that right now.
So i work on html,css,bootstrap,javascript,jquery and docker for project containerization, git for version control.

my work on the company project is developing new features, modifying old features, styling , bug fixes and recently i started to work on the script as a beginner which is in use to build the project.

just now i started to work on my own projects to showcase in github. so recently i only made very beginner level of project so after few days i can make my own youtube clone once i brushup my javascript skills. i am planning to use recact and redux for that. so already i started to work on and by not i worked on the react part only where i made some components and style the project like youtube.

and right now i am facing some issues in my office project to make style compatible for both browsers and some times i face issues related to https request for fatching and posting data to the backend.

for my personal project i have created a registration form and table. where i fetched the data and show them in the table so that was not that hard part. but now i have a form where i input details and i want to use post method so i can store those data to the database but for that first i have to create a backend of the project which will accept those requests. so i am working on that.

as i am working in a startup my team strength is 8 and in project 4 people are working. me as a frontend developer, there is a tester and backend developer and manager .

so i already told you like i have worked on html,css,bootstrap,javascript,jquery and learning period on reactjs for library framework. just now i told you that i have created a registration form and table data platform for a frontend part only.
